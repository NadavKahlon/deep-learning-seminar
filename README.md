# CLIP, GPT, and Their Applications: Exploring Large-Scale Pre-Trained Models in Deep Learning

This is a deep learning seminar I worked on between 2022 and 2023, as part of my bachelor's degree at OUI. It was graded 100 / 100.

## Agenda

The seminar explores the concept of large-scale unsuperviesed pretraining of deep learning models. The seminar is surrounded by the hypothesis that this AI-system development scheme may be key for our future advanecments towards Artificial General Intelligence, thanks to several of its powerful properties.

To confirm this hypothesis, we closely examine a couple of series of models by OpenAI, which were based on that scheme: CLIP and GPT. We thoroughly review their implementation (from scratch), performance, transfer capabilities, explainability, broader impacts, and custom applications by the research community.

### Paper

The entirety of my work is encapsulated inside a 60-page paper, see `complete-paper.pdf`. It was developed using OverLeaf, and its source can be found under `src`.

### Presentation

The seminar was also presented to an audience. Due to the presentation's time limit, only part of my work was included in this presentation. The slides are provided in `partial-presentation-slides.pptx`.
